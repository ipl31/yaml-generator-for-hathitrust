# YAML Generator Building Blocks

Each building block reflects a phase and goals of the project. They were retained to reflect distinct iterations of the code, however they are not necessary perfect reflections of the end goal phase of the project. An issue with one solution may have been discovered when working on a subsequent goal. They are retained primarily for my own reference and re-use.
